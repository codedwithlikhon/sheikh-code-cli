## Getting Started with the AI SDK

The AI SDK is the TypeScript toolkit designed to help developers build AI-powered applications with React, Next.js, Vue, Svelte, Node.js, and more. Integrating LLMs into applications is complicated and heavily dependent on the specific model provider you use.

The AI SDK abstracts away the differences between model providers, eliminates boilerplate code for building chatbots, and allows you to go beyond text output to generate rich, interactive components.

You can begin:

*   Explore the documentation at [ai-sdk.dev/docs](https://ai-sdk.dev/docs) to understand the capabilities of the AI SDK.
*   Check out practical examples at [ai-sdk.dev/examples](https://ai-sdk.dev/examples) to see the SDK in action.
*   Dive deeper with advanced guides on topics like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) at [ai-sdk.dev/docs/guides](https://ai-sdk.dev/docs/guides).
*   Use ready-to-deploy AI templates at [vercel.com/templates?type=ai](https://vercel.com/templates?type=ai).
*   Read more about the [Google Generative AI provider](https://ai-sdk.dev/docs/guides/providers/google-generative-ai).
